# 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This application utilizes node to allow the user to create their own README. My app dynamically creates a professional README.md file from a user's input in the command line by using the npm inquirer package. 

## Installation

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

The following packages also need to be included in the index.js file to run the app:

```
const inquirer = require("inquirer")
const generateMarkdown = require('./utils/generateMarkdown')
const fs = require('fs');
```
